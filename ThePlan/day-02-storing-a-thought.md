### Day 2 — Storing a Thought

**Goal:** Learn variables, types, and how to simulate a journal entry in code.

**Concepts:**
- Variables, strings, numbers, arrays, objects
- Data structure as “journal entry”

**Tasks:**
- Create `journal-entry.js`
- Write and print a journalEntry object
- Add multiple entries to an array
- Commit and log it as a ticket

**Per Team Focus:**
- **Team Alpha:** Consider how a journal-like structure might connect to task tracking.
- **Team Bravo:** Begin prototyping a consistent structure for a user's daily entry — maybe extract a reusable data model.
- **Team Charlie:** Think ahead: what stats could be derived from a week’s worth of entries? Moods? Time logged?

> **Team Bravo Design Prompt:** Start thinking about what your journal module might look like. How should it behave in the UI? What kind of entries will users log, and what features should be included for filtering or reviewing past days?

**Reflection Prompt:**
> “What kind of data structure would *you* want in your dream learning log?”

**Stand-down Activity:**
- Pair up and read each other’s journal entry structure. What did you do differently?
- As a team, sketch out a basic layout for the journal interface (on paper or in comments) — where would entries go? What might the filters or sort options be?
