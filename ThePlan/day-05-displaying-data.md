### Day 5 — Displaying Data

**Per Team Focus:**
- **Team Alpha:** Render a list of tickets to the console or browser DOM.
- **Team Bravo:** Render journal entries in a readable format, possibly grouped by day.
- **Team Charlie:** Start visualizing count-based metrics (e.g., tickets completed, logs per day).

**Theme:** Make it visible.  
**Goal:** Show your data to a user or teammate.

**Concepts:**
- Looping over arrays and printing/rendering results
- Basic HTML rendering or console formatting
- Intro to UI-first thinking

**Tasks:**
- Loop over your data and display it nicely
- Add a simple filter: show only tickets with `status === "todo"`, or logs from today
- Stretch: print data as a table

**Reflection Prompt:**
> “What makes something readable? Did your display help others understand the work?”

**Stand-down Activity:**
- Peer review: trade displays with another team and give feedback.
