### Day 1 — Your First Ticket

**Goal:** Get familiar with dev tools, write first JS, create your first ticket.

**Concepts:**
- Running JS in browser console and Node
- `console.log`, `let`, `const`, basic strings and numbers
- Markdown & dev logs

**Tasks:**
- Install VSCode
- Open VSCode, create `index.js`
- Print your name and a goal
- Create a folder `tickets/` and write `day-1.md` using a ticket template
- Commit both to Git

**Stand-down Activity:**
- What did you think programming would feel like? How was this different?
- Quick share: what was hardest, what was fun?


**Per Team Focus:**  
- **Team Alpha:** Create your first real 'ticket' — imagine what data fields you'd need if this were a shared board.
- **Team Bravo:** Begin imagining how this could be logged in a journal as well.
- **Team Charlie:** Think about what you'd want to track or visualize from these daily logs, what data would be useful for a dashboard?
