## Rivered - Game Rules

### 🎯 Goal
To break the ice, build team collaboration, and sneak in Agile-style estimation skills—using a deck of semi-personal questions.

---

### 🧩 Setup
- Divide learners into small **teams of 3–5**.
- Each team gets a set of number cards using the **Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8**.
- Each team also receives **1 wildcard card** they can play once per game.
- The facilitator holds a **deck of 50 question cards**.

---

### 🕹️ How to Play
1. **Draw a Card:**
   - The facilitator reads a random question aloud.

2. **Team Estimation (30–60 sec):**
   - Each team discusses how “deep/difficult/fun/personal” the question is.
   - They vote as a team using a Fibonacci number (1 = super easy, 8 = intense/awkward).

3. **Reveal:**
   - All teams reveal their number **simultaneously**.

4. **Answer Time – Default Rule:**
   - The team with the **lowest score** answers the question.
   - Why? Because they claimed it was easy—now prove it 

5. **Facilitator Override:**
   - The facilitator can **override** and pick any team to answer instead.
   - Use this to balance speaking time, keep energy up, or follow curiosity.

6. **Wildcard Rule:**
   - Each team may play **1 wildcard** to skip a question.
   - If a wildcard is played, the question is discarded and the facilitator draws a new one.
   - No team answers during a wildcard round.

7. **Optional Debrief (short):**
   - Ask teams why they scored it the way they did.
   - Reflect on differing perceptions: "What made this a 2 for you but a 5 for them?"

### 👥 Team Roles
Assign these roles within each team. They can rotate each round or stay fixed depending on the group size and time.

- **Estimator:** Leads the estimation discussion. Makes the final call on what number the team plays.
- **Spokesperson:** Appoints the person from the team who steps up when it’s their turn to answer a question.
- **Wildcard Watcher:** Keeps track of the team’s wildcard and decides (with input) when to play it.

---

### 🪄 Optional Variations
- **Override Tokens:** Facilitator has 3 visible override tokens to play per game.

---

### ✅ Learning Outcomes
- Builds comfort in speaking and reflecting
- Models estimation, consensus, and ambiguity
- Fosters trust and curiosity among team members
