# 🧪 Beginner JavaScript Course Starter (Vite)

Welcome to your first JavaScript project using **Vite** — a fast and modern way to build web apps!

This setup is minimal and made for learning. You don’t need to understand everything at once — we’ll get there step by step.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Make sure you have Node.js installed

You can download it here: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

To check if it worked, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This sets up the tools Vite needs to run.

### 3. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

You should see your project running!

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
project-folder/
├── index.html         # The main HTML file
├── main.js            # Your main JavaScript file
├── style.css          # Optional CSS for your page
├── package.json       # Info about your project and scripts
└── node_modules/      # Tools Vite uses (auto-generated)
```

You’ll write most of your code in `main.js` for now.

---

## ✅ Tips

- You don’t need to understand everything in `package.json` right away.
- You can write regular JavaScript — no frameworks required.
- Vite will reload the browser when you save your file.

## 📦 Building for Production (later!)

This creates a `dist/` folder with your final website:

```bash
npm run build
```

But don’t worry about this yet — just focus on writing code and having fun.

---

## 🧹 Resetting Your Project (if you break it)

If things go weird, you can:

1. Delete the `node_modules/` folder
2. Run `npm install` again

Or ask your instructor to reset it from a backup 😄

Happy coding!
