## Agile: A Timeline

### ‚≠ê Pre-1990s: The Waterfall Era
- Software development followed a rigid sequence: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment.
- Known as **Waterfall**, this approach assumed full knowledge of requirements upfront.
- Projects often delivered late, over budget, and failed to meet real needs.

### ‚ö° Early 1990s: Rebellion and Experiments
- Developers began seeking more adaptive methods.
- Lightweight and iterative ideas surfaced:
  - **1991**: James Martin publishes *Rapid Application Development* (RAD).
  - **1993**: *Scrum* emerges as a lightweight project management approach.
  - **1994-1996**: Alistair Cockburn formalizes *Crystal* methodologies.
  - **1996**: Kent Beck applies what becomes **Extreme Programming (XP)** on the Chrysler C3 payroll project.

### üìò 1999‚Äì2000: XP Takes Shape
- **1999**: Kent Beck publishes *Extreme Programming Explained*.
- XP introduces technical practices like:
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Pair Programming
  - Refactoring
  - Continuous Integration
  - Collective Ownership
- These ideas prioritize developer experience and rapid feedback.

### üèîÔ∏è 2001: Agile Manifesto
- 17 developers gather at Snowbird, Utah, to share lightweight approaches.
- They draft the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org), emphasizing:
  - Individuals & Interactions over Processes & Tools
  - Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
  - Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
  - Responding to Change over Following a Plan
- Signatories include creators of XP, Scrum, DSDM, FDD, and Crystal.

### üöÄ 2002‚Äì2010: Agile Adoption & Mainstreaming
- **Scrum** rises in popularity due to its clear roles and ceremonies.
- XP often partially adopted (e.g., CI without TDD).
- Agile certifications boom (e.g., Certified ScrumMaster).
- Many organizations confuse "doing agile" with "being agile."

### üß™ 2011‚Äì2015: Lean, DevOps & Software Craftsmanship

**Lean Software Development**:
- Inspired by Lean Manufacturing (Toyota).
- Emphasizes eliminating waste, empowering teams, and fast feedback loops.
- Mary & Tom Poppendieck popularize Lean in software.

**DevOps**:
- Merges development and operations.
- Focuses on automating deployment pipelines, monitoring, and CI/CD.
- Encourages shared responsibility between devs and ops.
- Tools: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

**Software Craftsmanship**:
- Re-emphasizes clean code, professionalism, and mentoring.
- Treats development as a craft, not just engineering.
- Strongly aligned with XP values.

### üåç 2016‚ÄìNow: Scaling Agile & Pushback

**SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**:
- Structured framework to apply Agile across large enterprises.
- Adds layers of coordination (e.g., Agile Release Trains).
- Criticized for being overly heavyweight.

**LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)**:
- Extension of Scrum for multiple teams working on the same product.
- Keeps Scrum principles but simplifies scaling.

**Spotify Model**:
- Describes how Spotify organized its teams (Squads, Tribes, Chapters, Guilds).
- Focus on autonomy, alignment, and engineering culture.
- Meant as a snapshot, not a framework, but often misunderstood as one.

**Backlash**:
- Many feel Agile has become a buzzword.
- Focus on frameworks over values.
- XP regains interest in dev circles as a return to core principles.

--- slide ---

### ‚ôª Ongoing Themes
- Agile is a mindset, not a method.
- XP provides the technical backbone many agile teams miss.
- The industry keeps rediscovering what XP emphasized from the start:
  - Feedback
  - Communication
  - Simplicity
  - Technical Excellence
