# Agile Beyond the Buzzwords  
## A Short Tour 
[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)


## ðŸ§­ Why This Talk?

- "Agile" gets thrown around a lot.
- But itâ€™s not just standups and sprints.
- Letâ€™s zoom out, starting with the **Agile Manifesto**, and ending with the often-overlooked gem: **Extreme Programming**.

---Slide---

## ðŸ“œ The Agile Manifesto (2001)

> *"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."*

### 4 Core Values:
- **Individuals and interactions** > Processes and tools
- **Working software** > Comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** > Contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** > Following a plan

**12 Principles** focus on:
- Early delivery
- Continuous feedback
- Sustainable pace
- Technical excellence

## ðŸ§° Agile in Practice: The Methodologies

---Slide---

### 1. **Scrum**
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team
- Sprints, standups, retrospectives
- Lightweight framework, widely adopted
- Great for **project management**, but assumes good technical practices

---Slide---

### 2. **Kanban**
- Visualize workflow
- Limit work-in-progress (WIP)
- Focus on **flow efficiency**
- Works well in operations, support teams, or anywhere work is continuous

---Slide---

### 3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**

[Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.extremeprogramming.org)

> Not just process â€” **a lifestyle for developers**.

- Born from real-world pain in chaotic projects
- Emphasizes:
  - Pair programming
  - Test-driven development (TDD)
  - Refactoring
  - Continuous integration
  - Collective code ownership
- Small releases, fast feedback, courage, simplicity

---Slide---

## ðŸ’¡ XP: The Soul of Agile

| Scrum | Kanban | XP |
|-------|--------|----|
| Process-oriented | Flow-oriented | **Code & feedback-oriented** |
| Roles & rituals | Visualization | **Practices & principles** |
| Assumes tech skill | Fits anywhere | **Demands & builds tech skill** |

> XP is where **Agile meets craft**.

---Slide---

## ðŸ§ª XP in Action

Examples of XP practices:

- **Simple Design**: Do the simplest thing that works
- **Refactoring**: Clean code constantly
- **Pair Programming**: Share knowledge + improve quality
- **Sustainable Pace**: No burnout = better product
- **Fix XP When It Breaks**: Adapt the system, donâ€™t abandon it
- **Collective Ownership**: Anyone can improve any part of the code, anytime
