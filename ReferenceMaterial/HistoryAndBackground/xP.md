# Planning Poker: The XP Way to Tame Chaos

---

## 👋 Intro: Estimating Is Hard

> "Ever tried to estimate how long it’ll take to clean your room, and five hours later you're organizing old photos?"

- Estimation is tricky, especially in software.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** aims to embrace change and deliver working software in small, regular iterations.
- One XP tool: **Planning Poker** — a quick, collaborative way to estimate user stories.

## 🎲 What Is Planning Poker?

- A **consensus-based estimation game** used in agile teams.
- Each dev gets cards with numbers (usually **Fibonacci**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …).
- Flow:
  1. Read the story/task aloud.
  2. Everyone picks a card privately.
  3. Reveal simultaneously.
  4. Discuss differences.
  5. Repeat if needed.

## 🤝 Why It Works

- **No anchoring**: Everyone votes blind, avoids groupthink.
- **Highlights uncertainty**: Big estimate spread = something worth discussing.
- **Encourages shared understanding**: Estimation becomes a conversation.
- **XP values in action**:
  - Communication ✅
  - Simplicity ✅
  - Feedback ✅

## 🧪 Real-World Example

> "Let’s estimate a login page."

- Dev A: “Easy — form, POST request.”
- Dev B: “OAuth? Multi-factor? Localization?”
- Votes: 2, 2, 3, 8 → 😬
- Team discusses edge cases.
- Final estimate: 5.

🎯 **Result**: Better shared understanding, not just a better number.
