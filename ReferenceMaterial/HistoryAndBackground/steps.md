# ðŸ§   Alan Kay's STEPS Browser

## ðŸš€ What Happened?

As part of the groundbreaking **STEPS project** (Software That Enables People to See), Alan Kay and his team reimplemented a fully functional **web browser** using fewer than **500 lines of code**.

This wasn't a toy browserâ€”it parsed HTML, rendered layout, and supported basic navigation. The team used a powerful meta-programming language called **OMeta**, allowing them to build concise, domain-specific abstractions.

## ðŸ”¢ Line Count Comparison

| Component         | Traditional LOC Estimate | STEPS Project LOC |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Web Browser       | \~500,000+               | <500              |
| Entire OS & Tools | Millions                 | \~20,000          |
